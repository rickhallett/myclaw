**"What Works" in Agentic Systems**

A curated knowledge base aggregating best practices, security considerations, and hard-won lessons from building AI agents.

## Contents

- **[Patterns](docs/patterns/)** — Proven approaches that work
- **[Security](docs/security/)** — Threats, mitigations, trust boundaries
- **[Anti-patterns](docs/anti-patterns/)** — Failure modes to avoid
- **[Resources](docs/resources/)** — Curated links to papers, blogs, tools

## Why This Exists

The agentic AI space moves fast. Good practices get buried in Twitter threads, blog posts, and private Slack channels. Bad patterns get repeated because nobody wrote down why they fail.

myclaw collects and distills this knowledge into a single, navigable reference.

## Philosophy

1. **Practical over theoretical** — Real lessons from real systems
2. **Opinionated** — Clear recommendations, not endless options
3. **Cited** — Credit where it's due, links to dig deeper
4. **Living** — Updated as we learn more
