Academic and industry research relevant to agentic systems.

## Agent Architectures

- **[ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)** — Yao et al., 2022
  Foundational paper on reasoning + acting pattern used by most agents.

- **[Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761)** — Schick et al., 2023
  Self-supervised tool learning. Influential for tool-use design.

- **[Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427)** — Sumers et al., 2023
  Comprehensive taxonomy of agent architectures and components.

## Multi-Agent Systems

- **[AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)** — Wu et al., 2023
  Microsoft's multi-agent framework. Good patterns for agent coordination.

- **[CAMEL: Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Language Model Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760)** — Li et al., 2023
  Role-playing agents in collaboration. Interesting for coordination patterns.

## Security

- **[Not what you've signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated Applications with Indirect Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173)** — Greshake et al., 2023
  Definitive paper on indirect prompt injection attacks.

- **[Ignore This Title and HackAPrompt: Exposing Systemic Vulnerabilities of LLMs through a Global Scale Prompt Hacking Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16119)** — Schulhoff et al., 2023
  Taxonomy of prompt injection techniques from competition data.

- **[Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043)** — Zou et al., 2023
  Automated jailbreak generation. Sobering for safety.

## Reasoning & Planning

- **[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)** — Wei et al., 2022
  The CoT paper. Basis for most agent reasoning approaches.

- **[Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601)** — Yao et al., 2023
  Extends CoT with exploration. Useful for complex planning tasks.

## Evaluation

- **[AgentBench: Evaluating LLMs as Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03688)** — Liu et al., 2023
  Benchmark for agent capabilities. Good for understanding current limits.
